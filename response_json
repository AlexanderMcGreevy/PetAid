{"possible_issue": "Injury or wound", "likelihood": "90%", "severity": "Mild to Severe (depending on the nature of the \"booboo\")", "explanation": "\"Booboo\" is a very general term, but it usually indicates some kind of injury, wound, or area of discomfort. This could range from a minor scrape to a more serious cut, puncture, or even a bite. It could also refer to a painful lump or swelling.", "recommendation": "I recommend that you check the \"booboo\" carefully. If it is a small scrape or minor cut, you may be able to monitor it at home. However, if the \"booboo\" is deep, bleeding excessively, shows signs of infection (pus, redness, swelling), or seems very painful to your dog, it is best to seek veterinary attention."}
